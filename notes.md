# Console Commands

# Notes
- An IP address can be given a domain to be referenced to.
- To get rid of the "Not Secure" sign next to the url search, you need to have a web certificate.

# Elastic IP Address Info
- Assigning an elastic IP address will change the IP address for your server, but it will not change again until you release the elastic IP address. If you do terminate your server and create a new one, you can again associate the same elastic IP address with your new server. Note that your elastic IP address is allocated until your release it, not until you terminate your instance. So make sure you release it when you no longer need it. Otherwise you will get a nasty $3 bill every month.
